## BigBang

BigBang is a tool for scientific analysis of Internet standards development and Internet governance communities.

With BigBang you can download mailinglist and analyze them using statistical, discursive, and network analysis. 

You can use BigBang to research Internet governance communities, but it has also been used to analyze open source communities. You can even use BigBang in class or in a seminar to teach the basic of Jupyter notebooks.

We have included lists of potential mailinglists for you to scrape (e.g. IETF, ICANN, RIPE, W3C), and a lot of Jupyter notebooks to analyze the mailinglists.

To start analyzing right away, have a look at the <a href="https://github.com/datactive/bigbang/blob/master/README.md">readme file</a>. If you get stuck, send an email to our <a href="https://lists.ghserv.net/mailman/listinfo/bigbang-user">user list</a> and/or have a look at the tutorial:

### Community
If you are interested in participating in BigBang development or would like support from the core development team, please subscribe to the [bigbang-dev mailing list](https://lists.ghserv.net/mailman/listinfo/bigbang-dev) and let us know your suggestions, questions, requests and comments. A [development chatroom](https://gitter.im/datactive/bigbang) is also available.

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers [pledge to make participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
